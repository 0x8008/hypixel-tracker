## Why use our product?
Hi placeholder,

The bad news: marketing burn is all too real these days. The good news? Help is on the way. New research shows that our platform can deliver:

-   72% increase in buyer engagement
-   50% in open-rates
-   20% decrease in attrition

How does 15 minutes next week sound to walk through how our customers achieved these numbers with our platform?

## Why is our product better?
Our product does not use the "programming language" known commonly as Rust. We do not use child toys. We only use real, useful and, more importantly, BASED tools in here, buddy. 
According to one of the wisest men on earth, namely Ankush Kushwaha from Quora, here are the downsides of Rust:
-   it does not have the level of monkeypatching supported by languages like Python or Perl.
-   You cant develop code as ‘fast’ as scripting languages like Python or Ruby.
-   You will have lots of ‘fun’ trying to get your code to actually compile.
-   Because it is a new language, people still complain about syntax.
-   its not webscale. /s
-   It’s usually considered harder to write code that can’t rely on garbage collection, even with the borrow checker helping you.
-   Compared to C++ and especially C, Rust often produces larger binaries and less efficient code; the compiler is also considerably slower. I think Rust can overcome all of these issues in time, but for now…

## Should I use your product?
Yes, *yes* in italics and **yes** again, but this time in bold.

## How to set the sniper rifle up?

Create the file /var/lib/hypixel-tracker/settings.txt. The correct formatting for this file must look like the example below:

    Discord webhook URL
    Hypixel API key (/api on Hypixel)
    The target's UUID (namemc.com)
If you cannot set up the file properly, it will not work. Not that it should be too hard to fill in three things.

## What are the .nix files?
Files for the BEST operating system in the WORLD, or rather, fuck it, GALAXY - NixOS and its Nix language.
Learn more about this MASTERPIECE in this article: [NixOS: the good, the bad, and the ugly](http://www.willghatch.net/blog/2020/06/27/nixos-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/#:~:text=NixOS%20makes%20it%20easier%20to,they%20will%20be%20built%20automatically.).
 
## What should I eat for dinner?
My recommendations will go towards pineapple (Hawaiian) pizza, fried rice with chicken, udon with beef, doner kebab with a spicy sauce, pork cutlets, carbonara pasta or instant noodles. And a nice, cold beer to crack open alongside your dinner.
